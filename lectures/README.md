## Week 01
### Practicum
- How to search in Twitter? e.g. type this `SVD (from:alfcnz)` in the search bar.




## Week 02
### Practicum
There are a few interesting questions raised in the lecture:

01. Why don't we use regression for classification? Devise an example demonstrating
that adopting one-hot vector is better than keeping the original labels.
02. `00:45:40` Alf asked, "What's the training loss of `0/1` epoch?" That is, before the training/right after training.
03. Try changing the `#(neurons)` of the hidden layer in the notebooks `../04-spiral_classification.ipynb`, `../05-regression.ipynb`
